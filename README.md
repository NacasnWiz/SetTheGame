# SetTheGame

This is a console application, without any GUI, restranscription of the board game Set.
It was mainly a personnal project to help me familiarize with C++ concepts.
I find the game playable as is but, as a dear friend of mine comically said: "You coded Set the board game, mate, it is _not_ playable."

If you find any bummer in the code, as I am sure there are many, please feel free to instruct me about them.

May you have some fun!

TODO:
1. A proper greeting for the player, explaining the rules of the original game would be good.
2. Handle the deck's end better (currently the program doesn't crash but is messy)
